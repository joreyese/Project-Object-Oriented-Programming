This workshop presents the initial analysis and conceptual design of the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The objective of this workshop is to define the problem to be solved, describe the system at a high level, identify the main entities involved, and establish the scope and assumptions of the solution before moving into technical design and implementation.

The project developed throughout the course is a domotic (home automation) simulator, which will be incrementally refined in subsequent workshops.
